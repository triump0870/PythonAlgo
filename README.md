===========
Python is a modern, easy-to-learn, object-oriented programming language. It has a powerful set of built-in data types and easy-to-use control constructs. Since Python is an interpreted language, it is most easily reviewed by simply looking at and describing interactive sessions. You should recall that the interpreter displays the familiar ">>>"" prompt and then evaluates the Python construct that you provide. For example,

>>> print("Algorithms and Data Structures")
